Hi, I’m Daria. A technical writer turned team lead.

<img src="/assets/images/profile-picture.jpg" alt="Profile picture" width="330">

I'm passionate about making the complex simple, be it APIs, SDKs, UX flows, or even satellites. It all started when I was looking at the text on the carton of an orange juice and thinking, "Well, they shouldn't have formatted it like that — a new paragraph here would make it so much more clear!" Or when I was going through the rules of a board game over and over, wondering why they had arranged the information in such unhelpful order! And then I found out I could get paid for that...

An English teacher by education, I stumbled upon technical writing by chance. With my skills sharpened by countless juice cartons reviews, I started my career writing docs for a wide range of tech products: education, crowdsourcing, advertising, smart home, app development, and route-planning services... It turns out that starting fresh in a completely new field can actually be a great advantage, because it allows you to bring the empathy of a "beginner's mind" wherever you go.

Hobbyist analog photographer, improviser, and ukulele player. Originally from the Far East of Russia (no, I'm not from Vladivostok — don't mention it to me, we're rival cities; I'm from [Khabarovsk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khabarovsk)), now living in Berlin.
