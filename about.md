## Welcome!

Hi, I’m Daria. A technical writer turned team lead.

<img src="/assets/images/profile-picture.jpg" alt="Profile picture" width="340">

I'm passionate about making the complex simple, be it API tutorials or satellites. It all started when I was looking at the text on the carton of an orange juice and thinking, "Well, they shouldn't have formatted it like that—a new paragraph here would make it so much more clear!" Or when I was going through the rules of a board game over and over, wondering why they had arranged the information in such unhelpful order. And then I found out I could get paid for that...

An English teacher by education, I stumbled upon technical writing by chance. With my skills sharpened by countless juice cartons reviews, I started my career writing docs for a wide range of tech domains: education, crowdsourcing, advertising, smart home, app development, and route-planning. It turns out that starting fresh in fields completely new to you can actually be a great advantage, because it allows you to bring the empathy of a "beginner's mind" wherever you go.

Hobbyist analog photographer, improviser, and ukulele player. Originally from the Far East of Russia (not from Vladivostok—we're rival cities, I'm from [Khabarovsk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khabarovsk)), now living in Berlin.
