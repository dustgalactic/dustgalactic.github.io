## Welcome!

Hi, I’m Daria. A technical writer turned team lead.

<img src="/assets/images/profile-picture.jpg" alt="Profile picture" width="340">

I'm passionate about making the complex simple, be it APIs or satellites. It all started when I looked at the text on a carton of an orange juice and thought, "Well, they shouldn't have formatted it like that—a new paragraph here would make it so much more clear!" Or when I went through the rules of a board game over and over, wondering why they had arranged the information in such an unhelpful order. And then I found out I could get paid for this...

An English teacher by education, I stumbled upon technical writing by chance. With my skills sharpened by countless juice carton reviews, I began my career writing docs for a wide range of tech domains: education, crowdsourcing, advertising, smart home, app development, and route planning. I now work in the [geospatial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geospatial_(disambiguation)) industry. It turns out that starting fresh in fields completely new to you can actually be a great advantage, as it allows you to bring the empathy of a "beginner's mind" wherever you go.

Hobbyist analog photographer, improviser, and ukulele player. Originally from the Far East of Russia (not from Vladivostok—we're rival cities, I'm from [Khabarovsk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khabarovsk)), now living in Berlin.
